# push_swap

The **push_swap** project challenges students to create a sorting algorithm for a specific problem: sorting a list of integers using a limited set of operations.  

## Steps:

### Step 0 - Understand the Subject  
The first step is to gain a good understanding of the subject requirements.  

### Step 1 - Learn about Algorithmic Complexity  
I began by reading about [Algorithmic Complexity](https://devopedia.org/algorithmic-complexity).  

#### Key Points:  
- What is Algorithmic Complexity?  
- Various types of algorithmic complexities.  
- What does it mean to state the best-case, worst-case, and average-case time complexity of algorithms?  
- How are these complexities represented?  

Use the link above to explore these topics. Afterward, try answering the above questions and study this image for a better understanding:

This should be enough to get started.  

### Step 2 - Study Sorting Algorithms  
Next, I read about several sorting algorithms, such as:  
- Bubble Sort  
- Insertion Sort  
- Selection Sort  
- Quicksort  
- Mergesort  
- Radix Sort  

#### Key Insights:  
I found that most of these algorithms either cannot be used in the **push_swap** project or require significant modifications to work within the constraints of the allowed operations.  

### Step 3 - Develop Initial Ideas  
At this point, I didnâ€™t have a complete solution, but I brainstormed some ideas for tackling the project. I also sought advice from former students who had worked on this project before. Their suggestions were incredibly helpful.  

One of the sources they shared was a [Medium Article](https://medium.com/@ayogun/push-swap-c1f5d2d41e97), which I found particularly useful.  

### Step 4 - Merge Concepts and Create a Base Algorithm  
The article provided some excellent insights, which I combined with ideas from other sorting algorithms. This allowed me to design a basic working algorithm as a foundation for further development.  

### Step 5 - Put general idea in paper
I have used a tool called [TLDraw](https://www.tldraw.com/) to create a full algorithm using follow card (i don't know if i can call it follow card XD) that you can found it here in this [Board](https://www.tldraw.com/ro/e7_fqo8dLkR8jHe5QtgyP?d=v4824.-10444.19200.9320.Ym7L05aVdUrCR4WmWzNFc).

### Step 6 - setup
I have create a repo and add to it [libft](https://github.com/ilorez/libft/tree/develop) (libft + get_next_line + ft_printf) because i found that i need all those functions, and i tried first to add some functions to libft that i will need later like: ft_atol, ft_free_list_of_strs and boolean type (because i want) ...

### Step 7 - start coding
After i really understand what i should do i start with creating the basic function like create_stack_a , is_all_digits, print_stack(for debug) and create basic header file
which is function what will run at top.
