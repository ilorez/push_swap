# push_swap

The **push_swap** project challenges students to create a sorting algorithm for a specific problem: sorting a list of integers using a limited set of operations.  

## Steps:

### Step 0 - Understand the Subject  
The first step is to gain a good understanding of the subject requirements.  

### Step 1 - Learn about Algorithmic Complexity  
I began by reading about [Algorithmic Complexity](https://devopedia.org/algorithmic-complexity).  

#### Key Points:  
- What is Algorithmic Complexity?  
- Various types of algorithmic complexities.  
- What does it mean to state the best-case, worst-case, and average-case time complexity of algorithms?  
- How are these complexities represented?  

Use the link above to explore these topics. Afterward, try answering the above questions and study this image for a better understanding:

This should be enough to get started.  

### Step 2 - Study Sorting Algorithms  
Next, I read about several sorting algorithms, such as:  
- Bubble Sort  
- Insertion Sort  
- Selection Sort  
- Quicksort  
- Mergesort  
- Radix Sort  

#### Key Insights:  
I found that most of these algorithms either cannot be used in the **push_swap** project or require significant modifications to work within the constraints of the allowed operations.  

### Step 3 - Develop Initial Ideas  
At this point, I didnâ€™t have a complete solution, but I brainstormed some ideas for tackling the project. I also sought advice from former students who had worked on this project before. Their suggestions were incredibly helpful.  

One of the sources they shared was a [Medium Article](https://medium.com/@ayogun/push-swap-c1f5d2d41e97), which I found particularly useful.  

### Step 4 - Merge Concepts and Create a Base Algorithm  
The article provided some excellent insights, which I combined with ideas from other sorting algorithms. This allowed me to design a basic working algorithm as a foundation for further development.
