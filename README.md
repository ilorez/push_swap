# push_swap
the push_swap is a project that challenges students to create a sorting algorithm for a specific problem: to sort a list of integers using a limited set of operations. 

## Steps:
1 - I have first search about what [Algorithmic Complexity](https://devopedia.org/algorithmic-complexity)
### what you should understand:
- what is Algorithmic Complexity
- various algorithmic complexities
- What does it mean to state best-case, worst-case and average time complexity of algorithms?
- how we represent this types 

Use the link above to read about that you should after that answer the above questions and understand this image, i think that enough for now.
